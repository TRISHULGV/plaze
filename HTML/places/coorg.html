        This refreshing waterfall gushes and pounds on the rock with full force especially during the rains and the roars echoes in the valley. The entire set up is gorgeous and looks right out of a storybook. Abbey falls is a part of river Cauvery or Kaveri in Karnataka that falls from an elevation of 70 feet making an astounding natural scene fro the shutterbugs to capture in the lenses. Trekking trails of Coorg are littered around the falls region. To get a better view of these falls, you can walk over the hanging bridge. The falls is under a private supervision and is amid stretches of the long coffee plantation. The green backdrop and the white foamy fall combine together to attract hordes of tourists every year from all across the country. It is one of the most visited tourist places in Coorg. </p>
